# Purpose
This repo is an implementation of [Learn-Blockchain-Programming-with-JavaScript](https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Learn-Blockchain-Programming-with-JavaScript) 
done in Typescript instead of javascript.

I was not a fan of the javascript style used in the book so decided to do it in typescript instead. I can't guarantee 
that I followed all the best coding styles, but did try to clean things up as I went.
